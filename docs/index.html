<p>BBGsymbols provides a collection of Bloomberg related helper datasets conveniently packaged for consumption in R. It can be installed from <a href="https://github.com/bautheac/BBGsymbols/">github</a> using: <code><a href="http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/topics/install_github">devtools::install_github("bautheac/BBGsymbols")</a></code>.</p>

<a href="#fields" class="anchor"></a>fields</h3>
<p>The ‘fields’ dataset gathers Bloomberg query fields that have been carefully selected over time through experience, saving the user long hours of browsing the depths of Bloomberg for the fitting fields. It provides popular historical and contemporaneous data fields that are likely to provide the necessary information and beyond for any rigorous research or more applied work in finance and financial economics. Financial instruments covered at the time of writting include ‘equity’, refering to any equity like security, ‘fund’ encompassing any money managing entity and ‘futures’ covering the futures markets. The author welcomes any pull request that could contribute to expand the current coverage.</p>

#&gt; 6 Black Sea Wheat Financially Settled (Platts) Futures\r\nUnderlying Price: The Black Sea Wheat Financially Settled (Platts) Futures contracts are based on the "Russian Wheat 12.5% Fob Black Sea Deep Water" price assessment published by Platts.\r\n\r\nPlatts Black Sea Wheat FOB Russia Assessment: Price assessments reflect Russian origin, soft wheat with a protein content of 12.5%, a minimum test weight of 77 kg/hl, a maximum moisture content of 14%, a minimum wet gluten content of 25%, a minimum W number of 180, a minimum falling number of 250 seconds, maximum bug damage of 1.5% and maximum foreign matter content of 2%. Wheat of other origin or with higher or lower protein content may be considered, but normalized back to Russian origin 12.5% protein. The assessments reflect cargo sizes from handy size to Panamax size, FOB Novorossiisk, loading 28 to 42 days ahead of date of publication. Cargoes are normalized to reflect parcels of 25,000 metric tons, with operational tolerance as per standard market practice. In the absence of representative, FOB Novorossiisk price information, Platts may also refer to other Black Sea ports or CFR prices in relevant destinations and will use prevailing spot freight rates and origin adjustments to normalize to FOB Novorossiisk.\r\n\r\nFinancial Settlement: The Final Settlement Price for each contract month shall be equal to the arithmetic average of the Russian Wheat 12.5% Fob Black Sea Deep Water" price assessments published by Platts for each day that it is determined during the contract calendar month, rounded to the nearest $0.01.\r\n\r\nTermination of Trading: Trading shall cease on the last business day of the contract month which is also a Platts publication date for the price assessment.\r\n\r\nLaunch Date: December 18, 2017</code></pre>
